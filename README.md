# DevAcademy Points
## A fun app for teachers to assign random points to their students - just for giggles, not intended for grading!

The project was created in 24 hours as a response to our teachers proclivity for randomly announcing:
`20 DevAcademy points to anyone who knows ${React Concept}!`
The DevAcademy points weren't real. So we made them real!😁

🎮 - Game aesthetic with a nostalgic throwback to the 64bit era

👩‍🏫 - Teachers can log in and award random points to students - for a good (silly) reason of course!

👾 - Users are represented by cute sprites from the olden days

👩‍🎓 - Only teachers from a list of authorised users can assign points

🧒🏻 - Students can easily see point allocations (and giggle at the reasons)

## The Future
### Issues and Updates

This project was originally developed under a 5 day time constraint. Believe it or not, it doesn't yet have all the functionality we want! The following updates are in the pipeline:

* React Native rebuild for mobile applications
* Multiple Avatar sets
* Reward and chore editing
* Confirmation modals for important choices
* Shared Family options
* Chore urgency for points bonus
* Diminishing returns on regularly completed chores

#### Bugs

We are aware of some issues logging in / signing up on certain browsers, and are working to fix the problems.
Given the quick nature of the product, some of the codebase is in need of major overhaul/refactoring, which we will undertake as we implement new features.
