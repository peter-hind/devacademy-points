# DevAcademy Points
## A fun app for teachers to assign random points to their students - just for giggles, not intended for grading!

The project was created in 24 hours as a response to our teachers proclivity for randomly announcing:
`20 DevAcademy points to anyone who knows ${React Concept}!`
The DevAcademy points weren't real. So we made them real!😁

🎮 - Game aesthetic with a nostalgic throwback to the 64bit era

👩‍🏫 - Teachers can log in and award random points to students - for a good (silly) reason of course!

👾 - Users are represented by cute sprites from the olden days

👩‍🎓 - Only teachers from a list of authorised users can assign points

🧒🏻 - Students can easily see point allocations (and giggle at the reasons)

## Just for fun

### A great 'just because' project!

This app really added a bit of fun to our lectures. The Mario inspired styling and sprite avatars were really appealing to the developer crowd! ![SuperMarioSuperMarioBrosWonderGIF](https://github.com/peter-hind/devacademy-points/assets/108807475/85f444b3-090d-4742-b6da-0575606242ae)


## The Future
### Updates

This was made pretty quickly for a specific group of people, but I'm going to be making the following updates sometime in the future:

* Ability to add new cohorts and switch between cohorts
* Build an Avatar
* Add / remove admins!
